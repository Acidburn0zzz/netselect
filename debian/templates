_Description: Do you want netselect to be installed setuid root?
 Netselect can be installed with the set-user-id bit set, so that it will
 run with the permissions of the 'root' user.  Since netselect needs these
 permissions to work properly, ordinary users cannot run it unless it is
 installed this way.
 .
 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by
 default.  If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled.
