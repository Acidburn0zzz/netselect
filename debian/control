Description: Choose the fastest server automatically.
 This is netselect, an ultrafast intelligent parallelizing binary-search
 implementation of "ping."  You give it a (possibly very long) list of
 servers, and it chooses the fastest/closest one automatically.  It's good
 for finding the fastest ftp.debian.org mirror, the least laggy IRC server,
 or the best Squid neighbour.
 .
 This version also includes netselect-apt, which creates an apt sources.list
 file automatically from the huge list of Debian mirrors.
