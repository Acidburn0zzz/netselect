Package: netselect
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends} 
Suggests: netselect-apt
Description: Choose the fastest server automatically
 This is netselect, an ultrafast intelligent parallelizing binary-search
 implementation of "ping."  You give it a (possibly very long) list of
 servers, and it chooses the fastest/closest one automatically.  It's good
 for finding the fastest ftp.debian.org mirror, the least laggy IRC server,
 or the best Squid neighbour.

Package: netselect-apt
Architecture: all
Depends: wget, netselect (>= 0.3.ds1-1)
Enhances: apt
Description: Choose the fastest Debian mirror with netselect
 netselect-apt will choose the fastest Debian mirror by downloading the full
 mirror list and uses netselect to find the best one. netselect-apt writes a
 sources.list(5) file that can be used with apt(8).
